Book CRUD Project
This project is a full-stack Book CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built with Next.js and Docker Compose. It allows you to manage a collection of books through a backend API and a frontend interface, all containerized with Docker.

Features

Read book details.
Update book information.
Delete a book.
Full-stack application with both frontend and backend within the same Next.js project.
Database and server are containerized using Docker Compose.
Technologies Used
Frontend & Backend: Next.js (React.js for frontend and API routes for backend)
Database: PostgreSQL
Docker: Docker Compose for containerization
Requirements
Docker
Docker Compose
Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
bash
Copy code
git clone [Your GitHub Repository URL]
cd book-crud
2. Set up the project with Docker Compose
Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed. Then, run the following command to build and start the containers:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose up --build
This command will build the containers for the frontend, backend (via Next.js API routes), and database, and start the application.

3. Access the application
Once the containers are up and running, you can access the frontend application by navigating to:

Frontend: http://localhost:3000
The backend API is integrated within the Next.js project and is accessible at:

Backend API Routes: http://localhost:3000/api/books
4. Stopping the application
To stop the containers, run:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose down
